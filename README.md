# PodDragon
My newest project, Readme to follow... but in essence this is a server which allows you to create custom Podcast feeds from existing ones.  

This will be API first, with frontends to meet.

## Getting Started
This is currently set up using the default Laravel installation, so follow instructions on [their site](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x).
